# SalesTracker
This is  part of a larger "do it yourself ERP" system.  This program shows how easy it is to import and create reports into Python, eliminating constant Excel importing and changing.

Tired of watching people constantly loading into Excel, making changes, adding notes to plot, etc. A total waste of time.  Created a short python program that shows how even though the accounting program is outdated, you can still export data in CSV file format and read it on with one click.

# SalesTracker
Python Demo -

This is  part of a larger "do it yourself ERP" system.  This program shows how easy it is to import and create reports into Python, eliminating constant Excel importing and changing.

Tired of watching people constantly loading into Excel, making changes, adding notes to plot, etc. A total waste of time.  Created a short python program that shows how even though the accounting program is outdated, you can still export data in CSV file format and read it on with one click.

Usage:
You must have python installed on your computer.  This python program was written on a Windows computer, but should run anywhere. Load csv files in the same directory as the program.  
1. Sales   = exported sales orders
2. Packing = exported packing slips of shipments
3. Orders  = "psuedo" database to store current orders
4. Targets = sales targets for the month

5. template.html = template file for the report
6. report.html   = final report in HTML format
